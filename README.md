## Contribution

Feel free to report any issues and participate in discussions.
Please keep in mind the following rules when it comes to contribution:

### No direct commits to the main/master branch

We work with feature branches, which means whenever you work on an feature you do that on the explicit branch. If the feature is ready, we **merge it with a pull-request** into the main/master branch.

### No merge without a pull-request

In order to keep things secure, every publish-ready feature or change has to be merged with a pull-request in order to discuss these changes and make corrections.

### No pull-request merge without another persons approval

Always request a review of at least one person before merging the feature.
