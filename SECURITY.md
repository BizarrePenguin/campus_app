# Security Policy

We treat security reports at highest priority level. This means that we attempt to fix them as quickly as possible. We will release a beta or hotfix for any major security report found in the most recent stable version of Campus App by AStA RUB.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please e-mail ``dev@asta-bochum.de`` with a description of the problem, the steps you took to reproduce the problem, affected versions and any known mitigations.

We should reply within three working days, probably much sooner.

We use GitHub's security advisory feature to track open security reports. You should expect a close collaboration as we work to resolve the security vulnerability you have reported. Please reach out to ``dev@asta-bochum.de`` again if you do not receive prompt attention and regular updates.

You may also reach out via Matrix by writing to ``domai@domai-tb.com``; however, please make sure to e-mail ``dev@asta-bochum.de`` when reporting a vulnerability, and avoid revealing information about vulnerabilities in public if that could put users at risk.

## Flagging Existing Issues as Security-related

If you believe that an existing github issue is security-related, we ask that you send an email to ``dev@asta-bochum.de``. The email should include the github issue ID and a short description of why it should be handled according to this security policy.

## Prefered Language

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Hall of Fame

We will create a public "Hall of Fame" for all security researchers those support us!
